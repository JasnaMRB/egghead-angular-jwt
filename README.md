# JWT Authentication with Angular
This is a sample app I built to familiarize myself with JWT authentication and Angular 1. It uses fake data from [faker](http://marak.com/faker.js/).

# Dependencies
nodemon - to restart server whenever there's a change
npm

# To run
`npm install`
`nodemon server.js`
Go to localhost:3000
