# JWT Authentication with Angular
This is a sample app I built to familiarize myself with JWT authentication and Angular 1. It uses fake data from [faker](http://marak.com/faker.js/).

# Dependencies
nodemon - to restart server whenever there's a change

npm

http-server

# To run
`npm install` - for first time only

## Server-side app

`nodemon server.js`

Go to localhost:3000/random-user

## Client-side app

`http-server`

Go to localhost:8080
